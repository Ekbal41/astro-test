              The spectacle of many gods appearing in the Sea Realm last time
              might have occurred during the last ominous battle.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              However, today, in the Graveyard of Gods, all the gods gathered at
              the goddess' star tomb.<br />
              <br />
              The majestic divine shadows were extremely solemn.<br />
              <br /> Anyone who saw this scene would be shocked.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              As for Han Fei, he stood up calmly and cupped his hands.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              “Seniors, I didn't expect you to pay so much attention to
              me.<br />
              <br /> In that case, I'll get straight to the point.<br />
              <br />” Han Fei was slightly surprised, but not much
              surprised.<br />
              <br /> The Graveyard of Gods was full of buried gods.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              If their remnant souls were still here, they might pay attention
              to him, or they probably didn't just pay attention to him, but to
              everyone.<br />
              <br /> At this moment, a god couldn't wait.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              “Boy, you said you could help us enter the cycle of reincarnation?
              Are you serious?” Confidently, Han Fei raised his head and looked
              at the god who spoke.<br />
              <br /> “I am the current Human Emperor, Han Fei.<br />
              <br /> I always keep my word.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              If I say I can help you enter the cycle of reincarnation, I
              can.<br />
              <br />” A god said, “Why should I believe you?” Han Fei
              sneered.<br />
              <br />
              “Senior, do you have a choice? How long have you been sleeping
              here? Do you have any hope of reincarnation? If you do, you won't
              be willing to choose a successor and try to pass on all your
              knowledge.<br />
              <br />” Ads by Pubfuture A god said, “Since the Primordial Era,
              the Path of Reincarnation has been severed.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              No one in the Age of the Gods dares to say that they can enter it,
              but now you said you could help us enter it within a thousand
              years.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              Boy, have you learned any news about the Path of Reincarnation?”
              Han Fei wondered if he should tell them about the Reincarnation
              Road.<br />
              <br /> However, this was a serious matter.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              If he told them that the Reincarnation Road was with him, it might
              cause trouble.<br />
              <br />
              Han Fei said proudly, “Apart from being Human Emperor, I am also a
              disciple of the Void Temple.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              I don't know if you know of the Void Temple, but as far as the
              Eternal Race are concerned, they don't dare to mess with our Void
              Temple.<br />
              <br /> I can reveal some information to you.<br />
              <br />
              The Void Temple has already grasped some secrets about the Path of
              Reincarnation.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              I wonder if this information can make you give up giving them your
              inheritances?” Buzz ~ Buzz ~ For a moment, the gods' momentum
              soared to the sky, their divine persona collided with each other,
              and they seemed excited.<br />
              <br /> “We know about the Void Temple.<br />
              <br />” “Han Fei, you've just grasped some secrets about the Path
              of Reincarnation.<br />
              <br />
              Are you sure that you can reopen the Path of Reincarnation in a
              thousand years?” Han Fei said indifferently, “The Void Temple has
              never lied.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              Now, the ominous is stirring, and some are already
              returning.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              But now, the gods in the Sea Realm and even the Sea of Stars have
              withered.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              Do you think the current Sea Realm can resist the ominous?” “What?
              The ominous has returned?” Han Fei said, “Before I came to the
              Graveyard of Gods, I had killed hundreds of thousands of
              destruction-level ominous creatures.<br />
              <br />” Ads by Pubfuture “The time won't be enough.<br />
              <br />” “No, there's still time.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              It will take at least tens of thousands of years for the
              dominator-level ominous creatures to return.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              However, if this is the case, when the Path of Reincarnation
              opens, we can't take a new path.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              We have to take our own old paths and return to our original
              divine position.<br />
              <br /> That way, there's still time.<br />
              <br />” “It's all that damn Eternal Race's fault.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              If I return to my divine position after reincarnation, I'll
              definitely fight this race to the death.<br />
              <br />” The gods discussed animatedly, and the goddess' eyes
              flickered as if she was thinking about something else.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              Han Fei said, “Seniors, apart from the people of the Void Temple,
              only you know this news.<br />
              <br />
              Apart from that, no third party knows.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              I'm telling you this because firstly, I want you to be mentally
              prepared.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              Secondly, most of those people just now came from the Central Sea
              Divine Realm.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              These people slaughtered 70 billion people of our human
              race.<br />
              <br /> I, Han Fei, am irreconcilable with them.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              As the saying goes, one has to be safe inside when fighting
              outsiders.<br />
              <br /> Therefore, I must kill these people.<br />
              <br />
              Not just these people, I will kill my way into the Central Sea
              Divine Realm sooner or later.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              Therefore, it's not that I don't give you face, but they are not
              worthy of inheriting your inheritances.<br />
              <br />” At this moment, killing intent surged from Han Fei.<br />
              <br /> The gods knew that Han Fei was serious.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              A god declared, “This matter will never reach the ears of a third
              party.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              The Graveyard of Gods is not a place anyone can come to.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              If the Path of Reincarnation can be reopened in only a thousand
              years, we won't sleep anymore.<br />
              <br /> A mere thousand years is nothing to us.<br />
              <br />” A god echoed, “We are all people waiting for death.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              We will definitely not tell others about the Path of
              Reincarnation.<br />
              <br />” Han Fei said, “Of course I trust you, seniors.<br />
              <br /> Otherwise, I wouldn't have told you this.<br />
              <br />” A god said, “Little friend Han Fei, your human race has
              lost 70 billion lives and you want to avenge them.<br />
              <br /> We can understand your feelings.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              However, can you be sure that these people are all your enemies?
              There are always good and evil creatures in this world.<br />
              <br />
              Although these people are not as talented as you, they have made
              it here with luck, strength, and temperament.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              Do you want to kill them all?” Han Fei stroked his chin.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              “If you insist on choosing your inheritors from these people,
              please set a test for them.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              Anyone who is hostile to our human race, can't take the
              inheritances! Because sooner or later, I will kill them.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              By the way, the people who came in with me grew up with me and
              became strong with me.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              They have cultivated for less than a thousand years but have are
              become peerless Heavenly Talents.<br />
              <br />{" "}
              I believe even if I don't say it, you should be able to feel their
              talent.<br />
